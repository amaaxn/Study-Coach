## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **The `learnium.railway.internal` URL is PRIVATE** - only works within Railway network
- **You need the PUBLIC URL** - generated by clicking "Generate Domain"
- **Always add `/api`** when using in frontend (`VITE_API_URL`)
- The public URL starts with `https://` and ends with `.up.railway.app`

## Alternative: Custom Domain

If you want your own domain instead:
1. Click "Custom Domain" button (next to Generate Domain)
2. Enter your domain (e.g., `api.yourdomain.com`)
3. Configure DNS as instructed
4. Use that domain in `VITE_API_URL`
